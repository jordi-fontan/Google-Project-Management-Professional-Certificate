## Office Green: Project Plant Pals

> Imagine that you're the lead project manager at Office Green, a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses. The Director of Product at Office Green has an idea for a new service called Plant Pals to offer high-volume customers small, low-maintenance plants, like little cacti and leafy ferns, for their desks. As the project manager, you've been tasked with managing the roll out of this new service. As we go through this course, we'll return to your role as the project manager at Office Green, to help teach you about project goals, deliverables, and success criteria. You'll also see the role your team and stakeholders play in creating and following these three important components. At the end, you'll compile everything you've learned into a shared document that you can use as a portfolio to share with future employers. After this course, you'll move on to the next phases of the project life cycle, and so will your Office Green project.
