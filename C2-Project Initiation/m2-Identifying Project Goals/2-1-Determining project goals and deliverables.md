# Defining Project Goals, scope, and success criteria

## Example to follow we'll follow for the rest of the course

##Office Green: Project Plant Pals


1. *You're the lead project manager* at **Office Green**, *a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses*. 
2. The Director of Product at Office Green has an idea for ***a new service called Plant Pals*** to offer **high-volume customers** 
       small, low-maintenance plants, like little cacti and leafy ferns, for their desks. 
4. As the project manager, you've been tasked with managing the roll out of this new service. 
 
>As we go through this course, we'll return to your role as the project manager at Office Green, to help teach you about project goals, deliverables, and success criteria. 
>
>>You'll also see the role your team and stakeholders play in creating and following these three important components. 

``At the end, you'll compile everything you've learned into a shared document that you can use as a portfolio to share with future employers. After this course, you'll move on to the next phases of the project life cycle, and so will your Office Green project. ``




## 0. Module Objectives

By now, you should have a beeter sense of how the different parts of the initiation come together to form the **beginnings of a project**.
The objectives of this module are:

1. Define & create goals and deliverables.
2. Define Project Scope, what is considered **in-scope**, **out-of-scope**, and **scope creep**
3. Explain how to define and measure a project's success criteria.

## 0. General

- We're defining project goals and deliverables and explain wht they're important.
- Then, we'll see how to determine whether a goal or deliverable has been well-defined  
(it's got enough detail and information to guide you towards success)

`` To set up a project for success, and to make your job easier, you want to figure out what needs to be done before you started.
You need to define exactly what your goals and deliverables are, so that you'll be able to tell your team members what to do ``
 
 You need:
 
 - A clear picture of what you are trying to accomplish. -----> ***Goals (met by deliverables) ***
 - How to know when it has been accomplished. ----> ***Succes criteria***
 - Be sure of what you have to dfo and what not -----> ***Scope***

## 1. Defining Project Goals

### 1.1 Definition

 ***Project Goal*** = Desired outcome of the project.   
 
 (What you've been asked for or you try to accomplish.)

Examples:

- Improve the response time of customers inquires via email by a 20%-
-  Project Plant Pal: Increase revenur by 5% through the new service

Goals are important because theygive you a roadmap to your destination.
Without a clear goal, where to go on? How to get there?

### 1.2 Good Goals

``Good goals need to be clear , specific and measurable.``
 
 - Improve the response time of customers inquires via email by a 20%-
-  Project Plant Pal: Increase revenur by 5% through the new service

They both say what to do clearly and how to do it(through new service) and when it'll be succesful (5%)
Really great goals have even more detail.


### 1.3 **PRO-TIP** :

When you start a project , take time to review your goals and make sure they're well defined
To do this, you might need to get more information from your stakeholders.

       - Talk them about their **vision** from the project
       - Ask about company's larger goals and **mission.**
       
 By the end of this conversation, you and your stakeholders should agree to support the project goals to avoid running into issues later


### 1.4 Project Deliverables

Once your goals are nailed sown it's time for examining the project deliverables.

***Project Deliverables*** = Products or services that are created for the customer, client or project sponsor.   
 
 (What is produced or presented at the end of a task, event or process)



-  Just like needing well-defined goals, you need well-defined deliverables for pretty much the same reasons.
-  Deliverables are usually decided upfront with the stakeholders or clients involved in the project. 
-  They hold everyone accountable and are typically a big part of achieving the goal.
-   Deliverables help us quantify and realize the impact of the project. 

Examples:

- Improve the response time of customers inquires via email by a 20% ------->  
 Mail template for responding to typical question
-  Project Plant Pal: Increase revenur by 5% through the new service ---->  
  launching the service and the website hightlighting the plants being offered
  
  
  These are consiedered deliverables because thy describe tangible outputs that show stkh how additional revenues will be generated.
  
 ### 1.5 Types of deriverables
 
 There are all sorts of project deliverable examples.  
 A pretty common one is a **report**.
 
   
   When a goal is reached, you can visibly see the results documented in the **chart**, **graph**, or **presentation**.
 
 ### 1.6 **PRO-TIP** :
 
  Make sure to ask questions about:
  
       - what the deliverable should be 
       - have everyone share their vision and expectations of the deliverables so that you're all on the same page.
