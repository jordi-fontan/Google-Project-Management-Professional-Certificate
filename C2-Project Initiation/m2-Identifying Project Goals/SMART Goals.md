##  SMART goals 

``get  goals as well-defined as possible ``

Goals are important to the success of your project, because
-  goals need to be well-defined in order to help keep your **project on track.**
-  **deliverables depend on your goals**, it's in your best
. 

### Definition

goals should be:
-  specific
- measurable
 -attainable, 
 -be relevant,
 -and be time-bound.

 ### 1. specific
 
> if your goal is not specific, you'll have trouble figuring out how long it should take to complete and whether or not
you've accomplished it.
>>For example, if the goal is simply to improve customer service response time, that's not very specific. It does tell you what you
want to achieve in general, but it doesn't say anything else. If you improve response time by one percent, is that enough? If after five years
response time finally goes up, is that enough? How about if only half of your staff improves their response times, but the other half stays the same. 

** Specific goals should answer at least two of the questions I'm about to ask. **
- What do I want to accomplish?
Why is this a goal? 
- Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit?
- Who is involved?
- Who is the recipient? Employees, customers, the community at large? 
- Where should the goal be delivered? 
- Finally, to what degree? 

In other words, what are the requirements and constraints? 

## measurable, 

measurable= meaning we can determine that they were objectively met. 

Measuring is not only a way for people to track progress, 
but also a tool to help people stay motivated. 

You can tell the goal is measurable by asking 

- how much,  
- how many, and  
- how will I know when it's accomplished?


Sometimes the success of a goal can be measured with a simple yes or no. Did you learn to play the guitar, yes or no? 
You will need to measure most of the goals you have with metrics. 

#### Metrics,
``What you use to measure``

> example, if your goal was to run a five kilometer race, then distance in kilometers is your metric.
>  At Office Green, the project goal is to increase revenue by five percent. In this case, revenue is the metric. 

#### benchmarks or points of reference

``to make sure you're choosing accurate metrics.``


>For instance, if your overall goal is to increase revenue, you can look at last year's data as a benchmark for deciding how much to increase revenue this year. If last year's revenue increased by three percent, then an increase by five percent in a booming economy would be a reasonable goal for this year. 

## attainable

 `` Can it reasonably be reached based on the metrics?``
 > You want goals that are a little challenging to encourage growth,( otherwise, what's the point of the goal if nothing's going to change?)However, you don't want it to be too extreme or you'll never reach it. You'll have failed before you even started. Aim to find a balance between the two extremes.

>>For example, let's take the goal to run a 5K. Say you regularly run 2.5 kilometers, three times a week. An attainable goal will be to go from running 2.5 kilometers to running five kilometers within four weeks. An unattainable goal might be earning first-place in the 5K.  it could happen, but it's not likely, 

 - how can you know if a goal is attainable, if it's unfamiliar? A clue to helping you figure out if your goal is attainable, is to ask: how can it be accomplished? Break down the goal into smaller parts and see if it makes sense. 
 > Going from 2.5 kilometers to five kilometers over four weeks means increasing your distance by a little over half a kilometer each week. That's not so bad, use the same process on your Office Green project goal. Businesses usually conduct quarterly reviews. 
 >> So let's assume that increase is expected to occur over the course of a year or four quarters. In order to meet the goal, you need to see an increase of at least 1.25 percent each quarter, seems pretty reasonable to me. What wouldn't be reasonable is setting a goal of increasing revenues by 50 percent
or 100 percent, unless your research showed that business was improving that quickly. 

### relevant. 

``In other words, does it make sense to try and reach this goal? ``

Think about how the goal lines up with 
- other goals,
- priorities 
- and values. 
- Ask whether the goal seems worthwhile. 
- Does the effort involved balance out the benefits? 
- Does it match your organizations' other needs and priorities?


1. Everyone need to feel like the goal is worth supporting.  

  - from the client, 
  - the project team, 
  - and the people who will ultimately use the product, 
  - 
2. Also, consider the timing. 
  -  Both the amount of time the project will take,
  -   as well as the larger economic and social contexts can have big impacts.
  -   
  -     There might be a budget to complete the project now, but will the company be able to sustain the project over time? 
  -     Is there an audience that will continue to use the product or service once it's delivered? 
  -     Once you've got the answers to these questions, you should have a clear goal to help steer the project. 
  -     If you still don't feel confident about the project's goals,keep digging. 
  -     It's okay to ask questions if you have doubts. Communicate your concerns with the project senior stakeholders and your direct supervisor
if you have one. They should be able to address some of your concerns so that you can feel confident about moving forward. 

### time-bound.

``Time-bound means your goal has a deadline. ``

- Deadlines give you a way to track your progress, otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started. 

- Time and metrics often go hand in hand, because time can also be used as a metric. 
- Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to break down how much needs to be accomplished over time. 

> For example, if you need to increase revenues by the end of the year, you can break down how much you need to increase each quarter, month, and week, and
there you have it. Specific, measurable,attainable, relevant, and time-bound: a nearly foolproof method to create an evaluate project goals.

``You know what they say, work smarter, not harder. ``

### RECAP


Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) goals are very helpful for ensuring project success.
SMART goals
 - help you see the full scope of a goal, 
 - determine its feasibility,
 - and clearly define project success in concrete terms. 

Let’s recap 

1. Specific: The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 

2. Measurable: Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.

3. Attainable: The project team agrees the objective is realistic.

4.  Relevant: The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.

5. Time-bound: The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

### variations
 
 > on what each letter in the “SMART” acronym stands for. (For example, you may see “actionable” or “achievable” instead of “attainable” or “realistic” instead of “relevant.”) However, the general intent of each of these terms—to make sure the goal is within reach—is always similar.

### Focusing on the "M" in SMART

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the M in SMART, which stands for measurable.
Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc.
***Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders.***

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project.

> For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. >> >> Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.

### Defining a SMART goal

>Let’s explore an example related to making a personal goal measurable. 
>>> Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a goal to complete a Google Career Certificate. You can measure the success of this goal because after completing the entire program, you will receive a certificate—a tangible outcome.

### Now, let’s determine how to make the remaining elements of this goal SMART.

In this example, your specific goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate.
- You can make this goal attainable by deciding that you will complete one course per month. 
- This goal is relevant because it supports your desire to make a career change. 
- Finally, you can make this goal time-bound by deciding that you will complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes:
``Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month within the next six months.``

### Key takeaway
Determining metrics can be extremely helpful in capturing statuses, successes, delays, and more in a project. As a project manager, identifying meaningful metrics can help move the project toward its goal. Additionally, by defining each element of a project goal to make it SMART, you can determine what success means for that goal and how to achieve it.
