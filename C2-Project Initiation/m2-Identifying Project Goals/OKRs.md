### 3. Some OKR'sCharacteristics

1. OKRs take SMART goals further ***by combining GOAL+ METRIC*** to determine a mesurable outcome
2. **Split diferent components of a sMART goal** and clrify even further (rather than group them in a single statement)
3.  More ambitious than SMART goals but still attainable
4.  It's used a a way of CHallenge/Strech Goals.
5.  Should be something haven't reached before.
6.  If all OKR's are met, they weren't well defined.

- KR2 : It may become a project itself
