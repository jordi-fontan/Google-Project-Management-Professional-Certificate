## Objectives and Key Results (OKR's)

### 1.What are OKR's?

`` OKR = OBJECTIVES + KEY RESULTS ``

`` COMBINE A GOAL AND A METRIC TO DETERMINE A MEASURABLE OUTCOME``


| Concept |  Def |
| :--- |:---- |
| OKR Def | It's a method  that help stablish/clarify Goals/Objectives for Orgs/Project/Dept/Persons |
| Objective Def | What is need to be achieved. Describes the desired outcome |
| Key Result Def | Mesurables outcomes than define when a objective is met |


### 2. OKR & PM

    - Expand upon project goals
    - Clarify deliverables
    - Stablish Scope (reason to say no)
    - Help motivate ( push past what's easily achievable
    
    
 ### 3. Set your objectives
   
   #### a.Objectives should be
   
        - Aspirational
        - Aligned with org goals

        - Determine what need to be done in 3-6 months.
     
   #### c Ask if each Objective is
          
          -   Helping achieve the project overall goal
          -  Aligned with company / dept OKR
          - Inspiring and motivational
          - Achiving it will make a significant impact
          
          
     
     
   #### d Examples of Objectives

  |  |  |   
   
   
### 4. Develop Key Results

        1. 2-3 KR per Objective
        2. Time Bound
        3. Key Result can be used to 
            - Imdicate amount of progress to achive in a shorter period
            - Define if an objective have been met by the end of the period.
        4. Should chanllenge/strech your team.
        
        
### 5. KR & KPI

| KPI | mesure the success of processes and avtivities not related to any task, i.e. ROI |
| --- |


1. Based mostly in KPI for things already done.
2. OKR for new project should be a bit more aggressive than those already achieved.

### 6. KR Examples:

    - x% new sing-ups in firt quanter past launch
    - Increment advertiser spend by x%
    - New feature adoption is at least x%
    - Maximum 2 crtical bugs are reported by cust per sprint

### 7. Criteria:

- Result oriented, is not a task.
- Measurable & verificable
- Specific & Time- Bound
- Agressive yet realistic.


### 5. Some OKR'sCharacteristics

1. OKRs take SMART goals further ***by combining GOAL+ METRIC*** to determine a mesurable outcome
2. **Split diferent components of a sMART goal** and clrify even further (rather than group them in a single statement)
3.  More ambitious than SMART goals but still attainable
4.  It's used a a way of CHallenge/Strech Goals.
5.  Should be something haven't reached before.
6.  If all OKR's are met, they weren't well defined.

### 3. How they work in practice

`` There are 3 OKR levels:  Project/ Department / Organization ``

| Concept |  Def |
| :--- |:---- |
| Company/Org Def | High level. Usually set at anual basis. Support org mission. Could be bases for project goals |
| Department/Team Def | Medium level. Team/Department aligned |
| Project  Def | Defined at init phase. Define Measurable project GOALS. Tracked to measure success. Aligned with Team & Org ones |


### 4. Examples

Lets see this Org Objective
    -  Increase Customer Retention by adapting to the changing workplace enviroment

In Order to reach this objective, Office Green may develop KR's

| OKR ID |  Def |
| :--- |:---- |
| KR1 | 95% of phone, chat & email customer support tickets resolved during first contact by the end of Q2 |
| KR2 | Top 3 most requested new offerings in pilot for end of Q2 |
| KR3 | Sales and support channel 24/7 by end of year|

- KR2 : It may become a project itself
- KR3 : Could lead to a Department Objective : Increase SalesTeam project Nationwide KR: 10 cities by the end of year
- Project Objective Enroll existing customers in Plant Pal KR= 25% of Existing customers enroll by EoY
