## Activity: Define and determine SMART project goals


### Activity Overview
In this activity, you will analyze a scenario to identify project goals. Then, you will write the goals using SMART criteria. 

    As a reminder, SMART goals must be:

    1. Specific.
    2. Measurable
    3. Attainable:
    4. Relevant
    5. Time-bound

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

### Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

> Office Green, LLC, is a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses. The company is getting ready to introduce its new Plant Pals service, which will provide high-volume customers with small, low-maintenance plants for their desks. You are the project manager assigned to manage the Plant Pals launch.

> Office Green’s main goal for this project is: “Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year by rolling out a new service that provides office plants to high-volume clients.”

You recently met with the project sponsor (the Director of Product) to discuss two additional goals for the Plant Pals project:

#### 1. Boost Office Green’s brand awareness

#### 2. Raise Office Green’s customer retention rate

#### The notes from your meeting with the Director of Product are below. You can use this information to create SMART goals:

1. Office Green’s customer retention rate was 80% last year, but the CEO wants that number to increase by at least 10% this year.
2. Last year, 70% of customers who left Office Green for competitors said they did so because they wanted more extensive services. When surveyed, 85% of existing customers expressed an interest in Plant Pals.
3. The Vice President of Customer Success expects Office Green to achieve a customer satisfaction rating of over 90% this year—a slight increase over last year. The rating has stayed between 85%-90% for the last five years.
4. The company plans to create an Operations and Training plan for Plant Pals to improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency.
5. Office Green will promote the new service with
      1.   a new marketing and sales strategy,
      2.    a redesigned website with a new Plant Pals landing page,
      3.     and a print catalog. 
7. With the publicity around the launch, Office Green projects that their customer base will grow by at least 15%.
8. Website traffic has dipped slightly over the past three years, from 15K to 13K visits each month. The Marketing Manager wants unique page visits to increase by at least 2K each month by the end of the year, which is in line with the results of prior marketing campaigns.
9 The project is scheduled to launch by the end of the third quarter. The project team will continue to collect data on the project’s progress through the rest of the year and assess how well it has met its goals at the end of the fourth quarter. (It is currently the start of Q1.)

 ### Step-By-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Access the template

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.” 




#### Step 2: Revise the goals to be SMART

The template contains the two additional project goals for Plant Pals, neither of which meets all the SMART criteria:

        “Office Green will boost brand awareness”

        “Office Green will raise their customer retention rate”

Turn these two goals into SMART goals using the information from the scenario above. Write the revised goals next to SMART Goal One and SMART Goal Two. Your goals should be complete, but brief—one or two sentences is enough.

                    For example, here is a goal that’s missing some of the SMART criteria:

                    “Office Green will soon create an app to help customers care for their plants.”

                    That’s not a bad start, but it isn’t specific, measurable, or time-bound. Here’s the same goal, rewritten as a SMART goal:

                    “Office Green will create an app that offers tips and reminders to help customers care for their plants. The app will be completed within 18 months and be compatible with 100% of the types of plants Office Green sells.”

#### Step 3: Explain what makes each goal SMART

    Now that you’ve rewritten the goals, explain what makes them SMART by answering the following questions:

    What makes the goal specific? Does it provide enough detail to avoid ambiguity?

    What makes the goal measurable? Does it include metrics to gauge success?

    What makes the goal attainable? Is it realistic given available time and resources?

    What makes the goal relevant? Does it support project or business objectives?

    What makes the goal time-bound?Does it include a timeline or deadline?

    Be specific in your answers. For instance, the plant care app SMART goal is:

    Specific: The team knows what they’re building: an app that helps users care for their plants and reminds them to do so. 

    Measurable: The app will be complete when it includes 100% of the plant types Office Green sells.

    Attainable: The company has the knowledge, time, resources to build the app. 

    Relevant: Office Green’s business model relies on customers caring for their plants successfully. 

    Time-bound: The goal includes an 18-month timeframe.

    If you find that either goal does not meet all the SMART criteria, try revising it and answering the questions again.

    What to Include in Your Response

    Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed SMART goals activity:

    Goal one is rewritten to meet all the SMART criteria 

    Goal two is rewritten to meet all the SMART criteria 

    There is an explanation for why each rewritten goal is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.
