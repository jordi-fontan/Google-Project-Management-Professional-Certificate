``Explore the key components of a project's initiation phase``

>Vinh works as an event producer at Formation, which is a tech company with 200 employees. He’s working on a project to plan the company’s annual employee conference. Let’s explore how Vinh initiates the project.




## Establish project goals

The theme for this year’s event is “community,” so that Formation’s teams can come together and develop stronger collaborative skills. 
Vinh talks to senior leadership and they agree that the event will span three days and accommodate participatory workshops for the company’s 200 global employees.

## Create the scope

The stakeholders told Vinh that they would like to hold small-group discussions, team training sessions,  
and a karaoke cocktail party—and provide transportation to/from all events. 
Vinh researches venues, vendors, and technology providers to ensure he has a sense of costs and logistical needs so he can define the scope.

## Define success criteria

The goal of the conference is to connect employees. To measure that, Vinh wants to know how many participants learned something or made a new connection.   
He plans to send a satisfaction survey to gather direct employee feedback.  
He also arranges to promote the survey on posters at the event and in post-conference emails.
