# Module 1: Understanding the key components of project initiation
## 1.1 Why is project initiation essencial?
  
  ```Basically, if the project isn't initiated properly, things can go wrong pretty fast.```
  
### 1.1.0 Project Initiation
In the previous course we talked about the 4 phases of a project

1. Initiation
2. Planning
3. Execution
4. Closing

Let's talk about initiation and why is so important for the succes of a project.
Because it is the first phase of the project, it's really important to get it right.

  **Why is initiation so important:** *A well planned initiation phase is a strong fundation for a project and sets it up for success.*

### 1.1.1 Project RollOut:

  
  
A project 

1. Begins after a problem or opportunity has been identified at an orgnization.  
2. Often is initiatiated by a senior leader to address a specific business need.
      Examples of this are:

	- 	Roll out a new product.
	-	 Improve employee well-being.
	-	 Reduce costs ina certain department.

### 1.1.2 The Project Manager Main Responsability

As a Project Manager is your ***responsability*** to help identify, from the initial meetings with hts stakeholders:

	- goals
	- resources
	- other details
and figure out all the important pieces that need to come together in order to get the work done.


### 1.1.3 Activities in the initiation phase

Initiation phase is the time for

	1. Ask the stakeholders the right questions.
	2. Performing research
	3. Determine Resources needed
	4. Clearly Document the key components
	
### 1.1.4 Benefits of a good initiation

Doing so, will help to solidify the Scope or boundary of the project.
- Getting on same page with stakeholders + gaining clarity can save a lot of time and extra work and lots of problems like
	+ Understimate project resources.(because project goals weren't understood)
	+ Thinking project is done when stakeholders don't think so. (by not setting success criteria)

> Proper initiation also helps ensure than benefits > Costs throught the Cost-Beneifit analysis	

### 1.1.5 Cost Benefit Analysis

>It's the process of adding up the expected value of a project - the benefits- and comparing them with dollars costs

- Costs
	- How much time will people spend on project
	- One-time costs
	- On going costs
	- Long-term costs
	
 - Benefits
 	- What value will the project create.
 	- How much money could the project  save.
 	- How much will bring in from existing customers
 	- How much time will save.
 	- How will the iser experinence be improved..

## 1.2 Key components of Project Initiation
-----

Let's see the key components that make up initiation, and how these pieces lead to the planning phase of a project.
In order to your project be succesful there are several things you need to consider.

### 1.2.1. **Goals** :
What you've been asked to do or What you trying to achieve.
	+  All projects should have clear goals
	+  and will be determined by senior leaders with your help
### 1.2.2. **Scope**: 
Work that needs to happen to complete the project
### 1.2.3. **Deliverables**: 
Products or Services you will create for your customers like:
	1. Features
	2. Functionalities.
	3. Proceses
	4. Documentation
	Anything that enables a goal to be achieve. They're submitted to help you reach your project goals.

	They can be tangible or intangible.
	- If the goal is to publish a book, a chapter is a tangible deliverable
	- If the goal is the implementation of a point of sale at a retail store,  
	schedulling a staff training session is an intangible deliverable.
1.2.4. **Succes Criteria:** 
Standards by which you mesure how succesful a project was in reaching its goals

1.2.5. **Stakeholders**: 

People affected in or interested by on the completion and succes of the project.

	- As a result they're often instrumental in determining the goals, objectives, deliverables and success criteria of the project,   
	from coming up with the idea to outlining the expectations of its results
	- As you move through the initiaton phase, it's your job to ensure you understand the ***needs*** of the project stakeholders early on.
	- I's also your role to ensure that all stakeholders are  
	in agreement on the goals and overall mission of the project before moving on to the next phase

1.2.6. **Resources**: 

Generally refer to the

	- Budget
	+ People
	+ Materials
	* and other items that you will have at your disposal

Very important to think carefully about these early on.
It would be a huge mess not having enough people or running out of money halfway.

After all that, you create the 

7. **Project Charter**: 
 Document containing all details of the project initiation phase.( the items above)
 
  ``` Project charters clearly define the project and its goals and outline what is neede to accomplish them   ```

Once you've drafted the charter:

	- Review the document with the key stakeholders
	- Get their approval
	- Move to the plan phase after project charter has been approved
